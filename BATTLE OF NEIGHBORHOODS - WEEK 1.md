# BATTLE OF NEIGHBORHOODS - WEEK 1

## BUY AN ELECTRIC CAR IN SPAIN?

#### Problem Description

On climate change, there are many actions that scientists and the entire population are taking trying to improve efforts, seeking a change and everything that contributes to reduce the carbon footprint.

An interesting initiative is to change vehicles that run on combustion engines. This type of transport contributes greatly to the pollution of the planet.

Electric cars are combustion-free vehicles and could even be less expensive because some of their components are maintenance-free.

However, the production of electric cars is recent and their costs are still high, as research and tests are still in progress.

In addition, charging stations for this type of vehicle could be scarce and this reason can make a difference when making a decision.

#### Data analysis - Case Study SPAIN

To understand what the current situation is, we are going to analyze a data set that contains the service stations available for electric cars in Spain.

Based on the analysis of the data, we can evaluate which are the cities in Spain with the best availability to acquire a motor vehicle.

We could also suggest which cities do not have enough service stations for this type of car and promote companies in this market.
